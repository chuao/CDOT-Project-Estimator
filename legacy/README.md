#### Project Objective:
Use historical data to develop a method that can be used to accurately predict constructions costs for upcoming CDOT projects.

#### Background:
Colorado Department of Transportation (CDOT) construction projects are under-estimated by 15.15% when compared with
proposals from the winning contractor. When estimating the cost of a construction project, there are many factors to consider. Factors include: understanding the
potential for missed scope (change orders), taking into account fluctuating construction material rates, historical costs and work histories of companies submitting proposals, etc. Current estimating processes rely heavily on estimator knowledge and can be considered
just as much art as science. While this can be an effective method of predicting construction costs, it becomes highly subjective and difficult to reciprocate. The aim of this project is to simplify and
streamline the estimating process using machine learning.
Data received from CDOT includes cost and estimator information on roughly 1,400 projects. The predictor used to develop these models is based off project unit quantities as they relate to CDOTâ€™s over 8,000 specific bid items.
